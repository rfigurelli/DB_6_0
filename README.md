# DB 6.0: What if LLMs are just a new DB generation?

**White Paper v1.0.0**
**Author:** Rogério Figurelli
**Date:** May 9, 2025

## Executive Summary

This white paper introduces the **DB 6.0 hypothesis**: that Large Language Models (LLMs) represent a sixth generation of database systems, where human language serves as the query interface and neural weights encode an emergent semantic network. Under this assumption, we pose a set of **Central Questions** exploring the reality and implications of a DB 6.0 era, including its impact on the path toward AGI and ASI. We then define **Key Solution Questions** to guide design—covering an LLM‑centric knowledge core, a natural‑language interface, schema‑on‑read reasoning, a conversational SQL bridge, guardrails for auditability, and incremental learning strategies. We outline **Core Principles** that must be validated for robustness and trust, present a **Comparative Analysis** situating DB 6.0 among prior generations, and propose a **modular architecture** to operationalize these ideas. Finally, we illustrate real-world and near‑term use cases (Current) and offer speculative projections for **DB 7.0** and **DB 8.0** over the next decade.
